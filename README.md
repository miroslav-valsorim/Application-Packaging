# Application-Packaging

Some packaging scripts I have created for current applications. Due to my work as Software Implementation Engineer (packager) I have created more than 300 packages in total in 2 years and a half. Those packages include technologies like Appsense, Installshield, App-v, Repackager and much more. Also some of those packages were created with bash scripting. Most of the VBS scripts I have reused in my personal packages. Active Setup has been included as an example of what it does and what is used for.
